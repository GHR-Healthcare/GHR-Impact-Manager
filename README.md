# GHR Impact Manager

## Version History

**1.7.1** - Pending $ KPIs + richer revenue tooltip
- Pending tab has a new 4-card KPI row: pipeline weekly run rate with Δ vs 4-wk actual avg, next-3-wk expected $, last complete week actual, baseline avg
- Pipeline $ computed as `bill_rate × weekly_hours` on pending + assignment workorders (B4 uses Awarded_Rate/Hours_per_Peek, VNDLY uses Bill Rate with 36hr/wk default)
- Trend chart revenue tooltip now shows week-over-week Δ% and a GHR/Affiliate split line
- Fixed GetTrendData reading stale `B4HealthESR2` — switched to the live `B4HealthESR` table

**1.7.0** - Revenue line on Trend chart
- Trend chart now overlays actual weekly revenue on a secondary y-axis (gold line, $ formatting)
- Revenue sourced from B4HealthESR2 Bill Total + STAGING_VNDLY_SPEND Client Amount, grouped by Sun-Sat week
- Honors the current system filter; transitioned systems dedupe (VNDLY wins when both report same week)
- Pending tab stale-record filter: records with no milestone activity in 60 days are hidden

**1.6.3** - Pending outlook rewired to match Trend tab deltas
- Outlook counts now come from workorder start dates (Trend tab data source) instead of submission RTO dates, so numbers line up with the +/- deltas shown on the Trend breakdown
- Workers deduped per system+status+week to match Trend's distinct-headcount logic
- Tab order: Trend and Pending are now adjacent; Financials moved one right
- API change: `/api/GetTrendData` now returns the `status` column on assignments and pending rows

**1.6.2** - Pending 3-week outlook split by status
- Each outlook week now has 3 sub-columns (Submitted / Offer Pending / RTO), color-coded to match the pipeline groups
- Expected-start date falls back to VNDLY's Ready-to-Onboard date when RTO is empty

**1.6.1** - Pending tab summary redesign + detail table width fix
- Pending summary table now groups Submitted / Offer Pending / RTO columns visually with color-coded headers and a legend
- Added 3-week outlook columns to the summary, bucketing GHR/Affiliate pending candidates by expected RTO date
- Totals row across all systems
- Detail table now fills the full container width (switched wrapper to `overflow-x-auto` + `min-w-full`)

**1.6.0** - Holt's forecast + clearer projection styling
- Swapped projection formula from linear regression to Holt's exponential smoothing (weights recent weeks, reacts to trend changes)
- Projection line now anchors at the last actual value so it connects seamlessly to the actuals line
- Pipeline / Pending / Projection dashed patterns are now visually distinct (fine dots / dash-dot / long dashes)

**1.5.0** - Trend Tab with Headcount Projection
- New Trend tab with 4-week lookback and 4-week forward projection
- Line chart showing Actual HC, Pipeline (confirmed), and linear trend projection
